### To launch the code, create a file called code.rcsc or name it whatever you want, input your program into that file, then launch main.py and type your filename in.

code.rcsc
```

### Please read docs.txt to know the documentation.
### Also, I recommend to look at example.rcsc to see how a simple calculator app looks like.
